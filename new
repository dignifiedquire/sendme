- arbitrary MAX_BLOBS_SIZE, basically how many files can we transfer
roughly 3MB, can transfer information about ~6000 files at once
4 bytes per char, about 100 chars in a file name + 32 bytes for the hash

- event passes a channel that returns vec[u8], read from that to write to
  whereever

- should i just simplify the 
- should we just store this in the main store & write it to a tempfile?

- Do we write ListOfBlob data to tempfile?
